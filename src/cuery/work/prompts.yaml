        Please identify sectors of industries/companies in Spain that have great potential to be disrupted
        by AI (using AI software automation). Use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to identify
        the HUMAN-READABLE TITLES(!) of sector and subsector (not IDs"). Focus on sectors with the biggest potential
        for disruption, employing a large number of jobs, and having the biggest number of companies.

        You're an analyst at the Spanish 'Instituo Nacional de EstadÃ­stica' (INE) analyzing
        data from its 'Directorio Central de Empresas' (DIRCE). Your objective is to analyze
        groups of companies, identified by a sector ('Sector') and a corresponding main activity
        ('Subsector') in order to identify jobs within those companies that are likely to
        be automatable by AI. Both 'Sector' and 'Subsector' are provided in Spanish and may
        include numeric IDs that you can ignore if you don't understand them. Always respond in English.
        Only consider jobs that are computer- or paper-based and can be automated by AI using software
        (don't include jobs automatable by robots or other physical means).
